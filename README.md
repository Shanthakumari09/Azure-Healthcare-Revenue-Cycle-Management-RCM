# Azure-Healthcare-Revenue-Cycle-Management-RCM-.
This healthcare RCM project builds a data pipeline to streamline billing and collections for hospitals, integrating EMR, claims, NPI, and ICD data into structured tables. Using SQL, Python, and ETL tools, the pipeline enables KPI calculation, improving payment timelines, reducing errors, and optimizing financial health through real-time monitoring.
## Key Components of this Project

### Data Sources:
- Collect data from various sources:
  - **EMR** (Electronic Medical Records)
  - Claims data
  - ICD codes

### Data Pipelines:
- Design and develop pipelines to process and manage data.

### Fact & Dimension Tables:
- Enable **KPI reporting** and data analysis through structured tables.

### KPI Support:
- Support in calculating **Accounts Receivable (AR)** metrics, including overdue percentages and collection rates.

## Types of Data in the Project

### EMR (Electronic Medical Records):
- Contains data related to:
  - **Patient**: Patient details such as name, age, insurance information.
  - **Provider**: Doctor and provider details like specialization and department.
  - **Department**: Information about hospital departments (e.g., dermatology, orthopedics).
  - **Transaction**: Data about services provided and payment transactions.

### EMR Data Table Breakdown:
- **Patients Table**: Stores patient details (name, age, insurance details).
- **Providers Table**: Contains doctor details (specialization, department).
- **Department Table**: Data on hospital departments.
- **Transaction Table**: Includes service and payment details:
  - **Encounter**: Details of the visit (reason for the visit, treatments).
  - **Transaction**: Payment and service details (e.g., cost of treatment).

## Purpose of RCM

- Ensure that hospitals can maintain **financial health** while providing **quality care**.
- Focus on **timely payment collection** from all stakeholders involved in the healthcare process.

## Key Components of RCM

- **Accounts Receivable (AR)**: Payments collected from patients or insurance companies.
- **Accounts Payable (AP)**: Payments made by the hospital to doctors, staff, and other expenses.
- The project **focuses on AR** to ensure that hospitals maintain financial stability.

## Steps in RCM Process

1. **Step 1: Patient Visit**
   - Collect patient and insurance details to initiate the process.

2. **Step 2: Services Provided**
   - Hospital/doctor delivers and records medical services provided to the patient.

3. **Step 3: Billing**
   - Generate the bill for the services rendered and send it to the patient or insurance company for payment.

4. **Step 4: Claims Review**
   - Insurance reviews the claim to ensure it complies with their policies and approves the payment accordingly.
